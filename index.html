                    Ethics are the moral principles that guide how someone makes decisions. In programming, ethics can
                    often mean choosing between the bad and the worse.

                    Ethical hacking is the process of hacking into a system for the purpose of finding vulnerabilities. Ethical 
                    hackers must follow the following rules:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Let the hardware and software vendors know about and vulnerabilities discovered</li>
                    <li>Let the company who hired you know about identified weaknesses</li>
                    <li>Obtain <b>written</b> permission from the owner of the computer system before hacking</li>
                    <li>Protect the privacy of the organization you are hacking</li>
                </ul>

                    According to Daniel Goleman, there are 6 leadership styles:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Authoritative.</b> In this style you define a goal and encourage people to get there, but let them
                            figure out how. One of the best leadership styles.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Affiliative.</b> This style lets you build an emotional bond with your team. You praise them for 
                            carrying out jobs and make sure they can share their views without hesitation. Effective when morale is
                            low or team dynamics are poor.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Pacesetting.</b> You work hard and demand that you do your best, and expect your team to follow. Works
                            well with capable and motivated teams, but is often seen as a negative style of leadership.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Coercive.</b> You tell your team what to do, and expect it to get done immediately. The team is not 
                            allowed to get creative. This leadership style can quickly demoralize your team.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Coaching.</b> You help improve the performance of team members by helping them set achievable goals and 
                            completing those goals.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Democratic.</b> The name says it all. You ask what your team members want, and use that. Good for 
                            building trust and respect.
                        </li>
