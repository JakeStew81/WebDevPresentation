                        Ethics are the moral principles that guide how someone makes decisions. 
                        In programming, ethics can often mean choosing between the bad and the worse.

                        Ethical hacking is the process of hacking into a system for the purpose of finding vulnerabilities. Ethical 
                        hackers must follow the following rules:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Let hardware and software vendors know about any identified weaknesses</li>
                        <li>Report the identified weaknesses to the organization who hired you</li>
                        <li>Get written permission from the owner of the computer system before hacking</li>
                        <li>Protect the privacy of the organization you are hacking</li>
                    </ul>

                        According to Daniel Goleman, there are 6 leadership styles:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>Authoritative.</b> In this style you define a goal and encourage people to get there, but let them
                                figure out how. One of the best leadership styles.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Affiliative.</b> This style lets you build an emotional bond with your team. You praise them for 
                                carrying out jobs and make sure they can share their views without hesitation. Effective when morale is
                                low or team dynamics are poor.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Pacesetting.</b> You work hard and demand that you do your best, and expect your team to follow. Works
                                well with capable and motivated teams, but is often seen as a negative style of leadership.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Coercive.</b> You tell your team what to do, and expect it to get done immediately. The team is not 
                                allowed to get creative. This leadership style can quickly demoralize your team.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Coaching.</b> You help improve the performance of team members by helping them set achievable goals and 
                                completing those goals.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>Democratic.</b> The name says it all. You ask what your team members want, and use that. Good for 
                                building trust and respect.
                            </li>
